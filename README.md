# Bioinformatics Open Course Notebook #1

## This IPython notebook contains code written for an online course
> ### The particular course is not mentioned within this README to prevent people from googling and plagiarising.
> ### Though I have still put my work up as it is an indication of my interest and continued sharpening of my Python skills.

This is a simple example of code, it involves:

* Finding a repeated snippet of DNA within a string of DNA. *
> Finding a substring within a string essentially.

* Finding the reverse complement of a gene. *
> Using a dictionary(Hashmap) to 'translate' a gene to it's complement.

* Finding a repeated gene within a genome. *
> Finding a repeated substring within a string.
